# About
There is a lot of interest in interoperability of Open Badges and Educational/Occupational Verifiable Credentials. This repo contains our goals, design drafts, and other research related to achieving interoperabilty.

This effort will eventually result in requirements, use cases, and/or draft specs to be formalized in the appropriate standards group. For now, our priorities are:
- exploring the problem space
- creating specification/schema drafts and prototypes
- getting broader community feedback

# Goals and use cases

- Wrap and sign an assertion with verifiable claims linked data signature
- Assertion of a credential definition as defined by the Credential Engine Registry
- Amending an assertion with further evidence
- Assertion that isn't valid until it's been cosigned by the recipient
- Add blockcerts transaction proof to signature
- Use DIDs for recipient and issuer id
